# meta-learning-splicing-mpra
Probabilistic meta learning with generative models in order to learning the sequence determinants of alternative splicing 

## Setup

Please install libraries in the `requirements.txt` file using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Use of virtual environments is optional but recommended. For GPU support refer to [the PyTorch docs to ensure correct the CUDA version](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/).

Also be sure to specify/change the `save_dir` and `data_dir` configs in the `main.py`.
